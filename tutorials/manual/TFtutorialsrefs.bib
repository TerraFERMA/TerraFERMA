	abstract = {Subduction zone magmas are characterized by high concentrations of pre-eruptive {H2O}, presumably as a result of an {H2O} flux originating from the dehydrating, subducting slab. The extent of mantle melting increases as a function of increasing water content beneath back-arc basins and is predicted to increase in a similar manner beneath arc volcanoes. Here, we present new data for olivine-hosted, basaltic melt inclusions from the Mariana arc that reveal pre-eruptive {H2O} contents of [{\textasciitilde}]1\{middle dot\}5-6\{middle dot\}0 wt \%, which are up to three times higher than concentrations reported for the Mariana Trough back-arc basin. Major element systematics of arc and back-arc basin basalts indicate that the back-arc basin melting regime does not simply mix with wet, arc-derived melts to produce the observed range of back-arc magmatic {H2O} concentrations. Simple melting models reveal that the trend of increasing extents of melting with increasing {H2O} concentrations of the mantle source identified in the Mariana Trough generally extends beneath the Mariana volcanic front to higher mantle water contents and higher extents of melting. In detail, however, each Mariana volcano may define a distinct relationship between extent of melting and the {H2O} content of the mantle source. We develop a revised parameterization of hydrous melting, incorporating terms for variable pressure and mantle fertility, to describe the distinct relationships shown by each arc volcano. This model is used in combination with thermobarometry constraints to show that hydrous melts equilibrate at greater depths (34-87 km) and temperatures ({\textgreater}1300\{degrees\}C) beneath the Mariana arc than beneath the back-arc basin (21-37 km), although both magma types can form from a mantle of similar potential temperature ([{\textasciitilde}]1350\{degrees\}C). The difference lies in where the melts form and equilibrate. Arc melts are dominated by those that equilibrate within the hot core of the mantle wedge, whereas back-arc melts are dominated by those that equilibrate within the shallow zone of decompression melting beneath the spreading center. Despite higher absolute melting temperatures ({\textgreater}1300\{degrees\}C), Mariana arc melts reflect lower melt productivity as a result of wet melting conditions and a more refractory mantle source.},

We compare using the Schur complement reduction ({SCR)} and a fully coupled ({FC)} approach to solve geodynamic problems which are characterized by incompressible fluids containing large variations in viscosity. The scalability and robustness of these methods is assessed by examining their sensitivity to the discretization parameter h and the viscosity contrast Delta eta, respectively. We demonstrate that the scaled {BFBt} preconditioner [Elman, {H.C.}, Howle, {V.E.}, Shadid, J., Shuttleworth, R., Tuminaro, R., 2006. Block preconditioners; based on approximate commutators. {SIAM} J. Sci. Comput. 27 (5),1651-1668] can be an effective preconditioner for S = G({T)K(-1)} G, even when the fluid viscosity varies in space, provided an appropriate scaling is used. The performance of this preconditioner is strongly linked to the scaling employed. Through a number of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our new scaling strategy ensures that the scaled {BFBt} preconditioner remains effective in scenarios where the viscosity variations are either locally smooth or discontinuous. Of the solvers considered, applying {FGMRES} to the pressure Schur complement in combination with {BFBt} and Our choice of scaling matrices was the most scalable and robust approach.

	abstract = {Several models have been proposed to relate slab geometry to parameters such as plate velocity or plate age. However, studies on the observed relationships between slab geometry and a wide range of subduction parameters show that there is not a simple global relationship between slab geometry and any one of these other subduction parameters for all subduction zones. Numerical and laboratory models of subduction provide a method to explore the relative importance of different physical processes in determining subduction dynamics. Employing 2-D numerical models with a viscosity structure constrained by laboratory experiments for the deformation of olivine, we show that the observed range in slab dip and the observed trends between slab dip and convergence velocity, subducting plate age, and subduction duration can be reproduced without trench motion (i.e., slab roll-back) for locations away from slab edges. Successful models include a stiff slab that is 100â€“1000 times more viscous than previous estimates from models of plate bending, the geoid, and global plate motions. We find that slab dip in the upper mantle depends primarily on slab strength and plate boundary coupling, with a small dependence on subducting plate age. Once the slab sinks into the lower mantle the primary processes controlling slab evolution are (1) the ability of the stiff slab to transmit stresses up dip, (2) resistance to slab descent into the higher-viscosity lower mantle, and (3) subduction-induced flow in the mantle-wedge corner.},
