	abstract = {Developing accurate and tractable mathematical models for partially molten systems is critical for understanding the dynamics of magmatic plate boundaries as well as the geochemical evolution of the planet. Because these systems include interacting fluid and solid phases, developing such models can be challenging. The composite material of melt and solid may have emergent properties, such as permeability and compressibility that are absent in each phase alone. Previous work by several authors have used multiphase flow theory to derive macroscopic equations based on conservation principles and assumptions about interphase forces and interactions. Here we present a complementary approach using homogenization, a multiple scale theory. Our point of departure is a model of the microstructure, assumed to possess an arbitrary, but periodic, microscopic geometry of interpenetrating melt and matrix. At this scale, incompressible Stokes flow is assumed to govern both phases, with appropriate interface conditions. Homogenization systematically leads to macroscopic equations for the melt and matrix velocities, as well as the bulk parameters, permeability and bulk viscosity, without requiring ad hoc closures for interphase forces. We show that homogenization can lead to a range of macroscopic models depending on the relative contrast in melt and solid properties such as viscosity or velocity. In particular, we identify a regime that is in good agreement with previous formulations, without including their attendant assumptions. Thus, this work serves as independent verification of these models. In addition, homogenization provides a consistent machinery for computing consistent macroscopic constitutive relations such as permeability and bulk viscosity that are consistent with a given microstructure. These relations are explored numerically in the companion paper.},

	abstract = {In the companion paper, equations for partially molten media were derived using two scale homogenization theory. This approach begins with a grain-scale description and then coarsens it through multiple scale expansions into a macroscopic model. One advantage of homogenization is that effective material properties, such as permeability and the shear and bulk viscosity of the two-phase medium, are characterized by cell problems, boundary value problems posed on a representative microstructural cell. The solutions of these problems can be averaged to obtain macroscopic parameters that are consistent with a given microstructure. This is particularly important for estimating the "compaction length" which depends on the product of permeability and bulk viscosity and is the intrinsic length scale for viscously deformable two-phase flow. In this paper, we numerically solve ensembles of cell problems for several geometries. We begin with simple intersecting tubes, as this is a one parameter family of problems with well-known results for permeability. Using the data, we estimate relationships between the porosity and all of the effective parameters by curve fitting. For the model of intersecting tubes, permeability scales as phi(n), n similar to 2, as expected, and the bulk viscosity scales as phi(-m), m similar to 1, which has been speculated but never shown directly for deformable porous media. The second set of cell problems adds spherical inclusions where the tubes intersect. For these geometries, the permeability is controlled the pore throats and not by the total porosity, as expected. However, the bulk viscosity remains inversely proportional to the porosity, and we conjecture that this quantity is insensitive to the specific microstructure. The computational machinery developed can be applied to more general geometries, such as texturally equilibrated pore shapes. However, we suspect that the qualitative behavior of our simplified models persists in these more realistic structures. In particular, our hybrid numerical-analytical model predicts that for purely mechanical coupling at the microscale, all homogenized models will have a compaction length that vanishes as porosity goes to zero. This has implications for numerical simulations, and it suggests that these models might not resist complete compaction.},

	abstract = {Subduction zone magmas are characterized by high concentrations of pre-eruptive H2O, presumably as a result of an H2O flux originating from the dehydrating, subducting slab. The extent of mantle melting increases as a function of increasing water content beneath back-arc basins and is predicted to increase in a similar manner beneath arc volcanoes. Here, we present new data for olivine-hosted, basaltic melt inclusions from the Mariana arc that reveal pre-eruptive H2O contents of [{\textasciitilde}]1\{middle dot\}5-6\{middle dot\}0 wt \%, which are up to three times higher than concentrations reported for the Mariana Trough back-arc basin. Major element systematics of arc and back-arc basin basalts indicate that the back-arc basin melting regime does not simply mix with wet, arc-derived melts to produce the observed range of back-arc magmatic H2O concentrations. Simple melting models reveal that the trend of increasing extents of melting with increasing H2O concentrations of the mantle source identified in the Mariana Trough generally extends beneath the Mariana volcanic front to higher mantle water contents and higher extents of melting. In detail, however, each Mariana volcano may define a distinct relationship between extent of melting and the H2O content of the mantle source. We develop a revised parameterization of hydrous melting, incorporating terms for variable pressure and mantle fertility, to describe the distinct relationships shown by each arc volcano. This model is used in combination with thermobarometry constraints to show that hydrous melts equilibrate at greater depths (34-87 km) and temperatures ({\textgreater}1300\{degrees\}C) beneath the Mariana arc than beneath the back-arc basin (21-37 km), although both magma types can form from a mantle of similar potential temperature ([{\textasciitilde}]1350\{degrees\}C). The difference lies in where the melts form and equilibrate. Arc melts are dominated by those that equilibrate within the hot core of the mantle wedge, whereas back-arc melts are dominated by those that equilibrate within the shallow zone of decompression melting beneath the spreading center. Despite higher absolute melting temperatures ({\textgreater}1300\{degrees\}C), Mariana arc melts reflect lower melt productivity as a result of wet melting conditions and a more refractory mantle source.},

The scalability and robustness of these methods is assessed by examining their sensitivity to the discretization parameter h and the viscosity contrast Delta eta, respectively. We demonstrate that the scaled BFBt preconditioner [Elman, H.C., Howle, V.E., Shadid, J., Shuttleworth, R., Tuminaro, R., 2006. Block preconditioners; based on approximate commutators. SIAM J. Sci.

The performance of this preconditioner is strongly linked to the scaling employed. Through a number of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our new scaling strategy ensures that the scaled BFBt preconditioner remains effective in scenarios where the viscosity variations are either locally smooth or discontinuous.

	abstract = {Several models have been proposed to relate slab geometry to parameters such as plate velocity or plate age. However, studies on the observed relationships between slab geometry and a wide range of subduction parameters show that there is not a simple global relationship between slab geometry and any one of these other subduction parameters for all subduction zones. Numerical and laboratory models of subduction provide a method to explore the relative importance of different physical processes in determining subduction dynamics. Employing 2-D numerical models with a viscosity structure constrained by laboratory experiments for the deformation of olivine, we show that the observed range in slab dip and the observed trends between slab dip and convergence velocity, subducting plate age, and subduction duration can be reproduced without trench motion (i.e., slab roll-back) for locations away from slab edges. Successful models include a stiff slab that is 100–1000 times more viscous than previous estimates from models of plate bending, the geoid, and global plate motions. We find that slab dip in the upper mantle depends primarily on slab strength and plate boundary coupling, with a small dependence on subducting plate age. Once the slab sinks into the lower mantle the primary processes controlling slab evolution are (1) the ability of the stiff slab to transmit stresses up dip, (2) resistance to slab descent into the higher-viscosity lower mantle, and (3) subduction-induced flow in the mantle-wedge corner.},

The equations define a length scale δc called the compaction length, which depends only on the material properties of the melt and matrix. A number of simple solutions to the equations show that, if the porosity is initially constant, matrix compaction only occurs within a distance ∼δc of an impermeable boundary. Elsewhere the gravitational forces are supported by the viscous stresses resulting from the movement of melt, and no compaction occurs. The velocity necessary to prevent compaction is known as the minimum fluidization velocity. In all cases the compaction rate is controlled by the properties of the matrix. These results can only be applied to geological problems if the values of the permeability, bulk and shear viscosity of the matrix can be estimated. All three depend on the microscopic geometry of the melt, which is in turn controlled by the dihedral angle. The likely equilibrium network provides some guidance in estimating the order of magnitude of these constants, but is no substitute for good measurements, which are yet to be carried out. Partial melting by release of pressure at constant entropy is then examined as a means of produced melt within the earth.
The principal results of geological interest are that a mean mantle temperature of 1350°C is capable of producing the oceanic crustal thickness by partial melting. Local hot jets with temperatures of 1550°C can produce aseismic ridges with crustal thicknesses of about 20 km on ridge axes, and can generate enough melt to produce the Hawaiian Ridge. Higher mantle temperatures in the Archaean can produce komatiites if these are the result of modest amounts of melting at depths of greater than 100 km, and not shallow melting of most of the rock. The compaction rate of the partially molten rock is likely to be rapid, and melt-saturated porosities in excess of perhaps 3 per cent are unlikely to persist anywhere over geological times. The movement of melt through a matrix does not transport major and trace elements with the mean velocity of the melt, but with a slower velocity whose magnitude depends on the distribution coefficient. This effect is particularly important when the melt fraction is small, and may both explain some geochemical observations and provide a means of investigating the compaction process within the earth.},

Rhea targets large-scale mantle convection simulations on parallel computers, and thus has been developed with a strong focus on computational efficiency and parallel scalability of both mesh handling and numerical solvers. Rhea builds mantle convection solvers on a collection of parallel octree-based adaptive finite element libraries that support new distributed data structures and parallel algorithms for dynamic coarsening, refinement, rebalancing and repartitioning of the mesh. In this study we demonstrate scalability to 122 880 compute cores and verify correctness of the implementation. We present the numerical approximation and convergence properties using 3-D benchmark problems and other tests for variable-viscosity Stokes flow and thermal convection.},

The proposed solution methods, based on a suitable approximation of the Schur-complement matrix, are shown to be very effective for a variety of problems. In this paper, we discuss three types of iterative methods. Two of these approaches use the pressure mass matrix as preconditioner (or an approximation) to the Schur complement, whereas the third uses an approximation based on the ideas of least-squares commutators (LSC). We observe that the approximation based on the pressure mass matrix gives h-independent convergence, for both constant and variable viscosity. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In particular, the general analysis is applied to the linearized equations of the regularized Bingham model of viscoplastic fluid. Numerical experiments show that the suggested preconditioner leads to an iterative method insensitive to the variation of mesh size and the regularization parameter of the fluid model.},

	abstract = {A theoretical model for the dynamics of a simple two-phase mixture is presented. A classical averaging approach combined with symmetry arguments is used to derive the mass, momentum, and energy equations for the mixture. The theory accounts for surficial energy at the interface and employs a nonequilibrium equation to relate the rate of work done by surface tension to the rates of both pressure work and viscous deformational work. The resulting equations provide a basic model for compaction with and without surface tension. Moreover, use of the full nonequilibrium surface energy relation allows for isotropic damage, i.e., creation of surface energy through void generation and growth (e.g., microcracking), and thus a continuum description of weakening and shear localization. Applications to compaction, damage, and shear localization are investigated in two companion papers.},
