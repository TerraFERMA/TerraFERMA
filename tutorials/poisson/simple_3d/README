A simple demo to calculate and visualize the solution of a 3D poisson problem
Files:
	poisson.tfml:  TerraFERMA tfml file to describe the 3-D problem
	poisson_3D.pvsm:  a paraview state file useful for visualizing the 3-D solution
			  to use:  open paraview
			     	   choose load_state to load the .pvsm
				   in the pop-up, choose the file build/poisson000001.vtu
