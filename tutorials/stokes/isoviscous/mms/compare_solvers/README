This directory contains several different solver setups for solving a manufactured Stokes Solution (see manual).

mms_direct:  uses a direct solve on the entire Stokes Jacobian
mms_fs_direct:  uses an upper triangular block pre-conditioner with direct solves on the K and \hat(S) blocks
mms_iterative: uses the same uppter triangular block pre-conditioner but with a nested multi-grid preconditioner on the K block and (cg,sor) on the \hat(S) block

To compare the different solvers for convergence, ksp_convergence and timing, you can run the testharness file compare_solvers.shml
which requires that several environment variables be set first.

To run do:

. ./environment
tfsimulationharness --test compare_solvers.shml

or just try the shell script

./compare_solvers.sh

Once all the parameter sweeps have run,  if you just want to replot or add another test you can use
tfsimulationharness --just-test compare_solvers.shml

run
tfsimulationharness -h
