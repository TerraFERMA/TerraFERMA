# *TerraFERMA*

TerraFERMA is the *Transparent Finite Element Rapid Model Assembler*, a software system for the  rapid and reproducible construction and exploration of  coupled  multi-physics models.  

TerraFERMA is a software system for the  rapid and reproducible construction and exploration of  coupled  multi-physics models.  It
leverages three advanced open-source libraries for scientific computation that provide high level problem description
([FEniCS](http://fenicsproject.org)), composable solvers for coupled multi-physics problems ([PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc))
and a science neutral options handling system
([SPuD](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/engineering/departments/earth-science/research/research-groups/amcg/software/spud/)) that allows the hierarchical management of all model options.  
  
TerraFERMA inherits most of its functionality from the underlying libraries but adds a layer of control and guidance for building reusable and reproducible applications.  

Further discussion, installation instructions and documentation can be found on the [wiki](../../wiki).
