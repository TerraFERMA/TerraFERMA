# *TerraFERMA*

TerraFERMA is the *Transparent Finite Element Rapid Model Assembler*, a software system for the  rapid and reproducible construction and exploration of  coupled  multi-physics models.  

TerraFERMA leverages three advanced open-source libraries for scientific computation that provide high level problem description
([FEniCS][fenics]), composable solvers for coupled multi-physics problems ([PETSc][petsc])
and a science neutral options handling system ([SPuD][spud]) that allows the hierarchical management of all model options.  
  
TerraFERMA inherits most of its functionality from the underlying libraries but adds a layer of control and guidance for building
reusable and reproducible applications.

Further discussion, installation instructions and documentation can be found on the [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/tferma/tferma/wiki/).
