# TerraFERMA dev docker image

Welcome to TerraFERMA!

This docker image contains a complete installation of TerraFERMA and its dependencies, PETSc, FEniCS and SPuD, within an Ubuntu
20.04LTS OS.

The environment variables have been set automatically using environment modules and it should now be possible to build and run
TerraFERMA models within this container.  Opening the diamond GUI (and other visualization tools) depends on having forwarded the
X11 connection correctly from this docker container to the local machine.  Additionally the `shared` directory is available to use 
as shared volume with the local machine but depends on the correct configuration being used at startup.

The folders `tests` and `tutorials` contain links to the installed testing and tutorial suites for TerraFERMA.  Additional input
files can be downloaded directly to this container or shared via the local machine.  For example, the benchmarking suite can be 
obtained from the TerraFERMA github repositories.
